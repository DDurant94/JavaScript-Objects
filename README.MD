About:
In this repository, I explore JavaScript objects. I begin my adventure by creating a constructor function that serves as a base for all my operations. Afterward, I enhance its functionality by storing objects in an array, allowing me to manipulate them later. Additionally, Iâ€™ve implemented user validation within my program to prevent duplications within the database. So, Come and join me on this adventure of a lifetime.
